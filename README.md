# VHDLCommLib

Welcome to VHDLCommLib, a comprehensive library of communication protocols implemented in VHDL. This repository aims to provide high-quality, reusable VHDL modules for a wide range of communication standards, making it easier for developers and engineers to integrate robust communication capabilities into their FPGA and hardware designs.

## Features
- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**
- **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)**
- **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)**
- **CAN (Controller Area Network)**
- **TDM (Time-Division Multiplexing)**
- **Ethernet**
- **RS-232/RS-485**

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/lucjoh/VHDLCommLib.git`
2. **Explore the Protocols**: Navigate through the directories to find the VHDL implementations and documentation for each protocol.
3. **Integrate and Test**: Use the provided modules and testbenches to integrate the protocols into your own designs and verify their functionality.
